      brief: Presents an AskUserQuestion and routes based on response
      detail: |
        A user_prompt node presents a question to the user via the AskUserQuestion tool
        and routes based on their response. Each response option can optionally execute
        consequences before routing to the next node.

        This enables user-driven branching in workflows while maintaining deterministic
        behavior once a choice is made.
      notes:
        - Maps to Claude Code's AskUserQuestion tool
        - Header must be 12 characters or less
        - Options array should have 2-4 items
        - User responses are stored in state.user_responses
        - Each response handler can execute consequences before routing
