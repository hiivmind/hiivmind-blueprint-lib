usage: |
  These examples are documentary only - they are snippets and fragments
  intended to illustrate usage patterns. They are not validated against
  JSON schemas and may be incomplete on their own.

  To use a pattern:
  1. Find the relevant example in the appropriate file
  2. Adapt the YAML to your workflow context
  3. Ensure all required parameters are provided
  4. Validate your complete workflow against the schema

migration_note: |
  v3.0 consolidated 38 specific types into 13 general-purpose types.
  See docs/v3-migration.md for complete migration guide.
